                    <h2>How to Use the Course Selector</h2>
                    <p>This tool helps you plan your academic journey by showing which courses you're eligible to take
                        based on your completed coursework.</p>

                    <h3>Simple Steps:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Check the boxes next to all courses you've already completed</li>
                        <li>Click the "Show Available Courses" button</li>
                        <li>View the list of courses you're now eligible to take</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <p>The system tracks prerequisites for each course. A course becomes available when you've completed
                        all its prerequisites.</p>

                        <strong>Note:</strong> This is a basic version of the course selection helper. In a complete
                        version, more detailed prerequisite relationships would be implemented.
